    "Dijkstra's Algorithm is a famous algorithm named after its inventor, a Turin Award laureate. The structure is somewhat similar to Breadth First Search. A profound understanding of BFS is definitely beneficial to the study of Dijkstra's Algorithm. In the previous chapter, we have tested BFS and DFS in unweighted DCG. This time, we use weighted DCG. Each weight denotes the distance from one vertex to another. Dijkstra's Algorithm will help us find the shortest path from point A to point B with the minimum weights.\n",
